You're trying to build the Chopsticks version of Stockfish — let’s call it Chopfish (or Stockfingers, lmao). It’ll be an engine that not only predicts and evaluates positions, but also makes optimal moves using both search and a dataset of solved games as an oracle.

Buckle up — here's everything we can and should do.

---

GOAL: Chopsticks Engine with AI & Dataset Integration

What It Should Do

1. Evaluate any given board state

2. Suggest the best move (like Stockfish)

3. Play complete games against humans or AIs

4. Fallback to perfect data when possible (from the ≤10-move dataset)

5. Learn dynamically over time (if we go neural later)

---

CORE ARCHITECTURE

1. Input Module

Accepts a state input in format like = 2-3 | 1-2

Parses it into usable data structure (tuples or object)

---

2. Solved Game Lookup (Oracle Mode)

When engine is fed a state:

It hashes it or pattern-matches it against your solved ≤10-move database

If found:

Returns the exact best move from that dataset

Also tells user: “Perfect line found. Forced mate in 5.”

If not found: passes it to the search/eval engine

> This makes your engine super fast for endgames and absolutely unbeatable once the opponent is in the trap zone

---

3. Evaluation Engine (Search Mode)

If state isn't in solved DB:

Starts minimax or alpha-beta pruning search from current state

Evaluates future states using:

Terminal scoring (+∞ if you win, -∞ if opponent does)

Heuristics if needed (see below)

Prunes bad branches

Returns:

Best move

Evaluation score

Path preview (e.g. predicted next 3 moves)

---

4. Evaluation Function (Your "positional brain")

Possible Heuristics:

Number of alive hands (2 vs 1 = strong)

Fingers advantage (4|3 vs 1|1? Big lead)

Trap setup potential (e.g., baiting into mod-5 wrap)

Split potential (flexibility > rigidity)

Dead hand state (1|0 = vulnerability)

Mirror lock (can't split? you're stuck, bad eval)

Score each state with a total number, e.g. +50 good, -100 bad.

---

5. Move Generator

Already exists in your script:

All legal taps

All legal splits (filtering out reversals, 1|0, etc.) Just reuse that engine, make it cleanly callable from any function.

---

6. Search Tree Visualization (optional but sexy)

Could show in console:

Evaluating: 2-3|1-1
 ├── P1L>P2L → 2-3|3-1
 │    ├── P2R>P1R → 2-4|3-1
 │    └── ...

Shows path depth, move scores, etc.

---

BONUS FEATURES

Opening Book

Like chess has “Sicilian Defense,” Chopsticks has opening metas:

Fast kills

Bait-split traps

Defensive splits to 1|1

You could build an opening library from all games ending in ≤6 moves and prioritize them if starting from 1-1|1-1.

---

Blunder Detection

If a player plays:

A move that leads to forced loss

When a better option exists (provable win)

Engine can:

Flag it as a blunder

Suggest a refutation line

---

Engine Strength Tiers

Add difficulty modes:

Novice: plays legal moves randomly

Intermediate: uses shallow minimax (2–3 moves ahead)

Master: uses deep pruning + dataset fallback

---

Integration With UI

Imagine if this were in a GUI like:

Buttons for each tap/split

Engine reacts instantly

Shows score bar like chess.com

---

Multiplayer Analysis

Let two humans play, engine watches silently and:

Annotates each move

Says things like: “Missed win in 3” or “Brilliant trap setup”

Future-Proofing: Neural Engine

You could eventually train a neural net:

Inputs: state representation (one-hot of fingers, maybe 8 total values)

Outputs: policy (best move), and value (chances of winning)

Train on the dataset you already generated!

That’s how AlphaZero-style engines work — self-learn via reinforcement.

---

Your Stack is READY. You're Ready.

You already have game rules, movegen, validation, notation, and datasets.

All you need to add is:

Evaluator

Search

Dataset lookup

Optional UI/CLI loop

It’s literally like having Stockfish’s rulebook and now needing the brain.

Wanna start building the actual engine loop and plug in dataset lookup? I can walk you through building engine.py next.

Ive attached a prompt and a file, the prompt is describing rules and notations of game, the file, Ive attached a script for creating the precounted games, run that script and keep a certain amount of games in the storage of that file
