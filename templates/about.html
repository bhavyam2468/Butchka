                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            Chopsticks (also known as "Fingers") is a hand game played by two players. Each player starts with 1 finger on each hand, and the objective is to make your opponent have 0 fingers on both hands.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Game Setup</h4>
                        <p>
                            Each player begins with 1 finger extended on each hand, represented as "1-1" for each player.
                            The initial game state is notated as "= 1-1 | 1-1", where the notation means "Player 1 Left-Right | Player 2 Left-Right".
                        </p>

                        <h4>Game Moves</h4>
                        <p>
                            On a player's turn, they must make one of two possible moves:
                        </p>

                        <h5>1. Tap</h5>
                        <p>
                            A player can tap one of their non-dead hands (hand with at least 1 finger) against one of their opponent's non-dead hands.
                            This adds the number of fingers on the attacking hand to the defending hand.
                            The resulting number is calculated using modulo 5 arithmetic.
                            When a hand's count reaches exactly 5, it "dies" and is set to 0.
                        </p>
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If Player 1 has 2 fingers on their left hand and taps Player 2's right hand which has 3 fingers, Player 2's right hand will have (2+3) % 5 = 0 fingers after the tap. The notation would be: <code>P1L>P2R</code>
                        </div>

                        <h5>2. Split</h5>
                        <p>
                            A player can redistribute their fingers between their two hands, provided:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total number of fingers remains the same</li>
                            <li>Both hands have between 0 and 4 fingers after the split</li>
                            <li>The resulting configuration is different from the current one</li>
                            <li>The player has at least 2 total fingers</li>
                            <li>The split does not reverse the current state (e.g., 1-3 → 3-1 is not allowed)</li>
                            <li>Cannot split from a 1-0 or 0-1 configuration</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If Player 2 has 4 fingers on their left hand and 0 on their right, they could split to 2-2. The notation would be: <code>Sp(P2:4|0 → 2|2)</code>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Additional Rules</h4>
                        <h5>State Repetition</h5>
                        <p>
                            A complete game state (all 4 hands' values) cannot be repeated during a game. If a move would recreate a previous state, it is illegal.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Game End</h5>
                        <p>
                            The game ends when one player has 0 fingers on both hands. That player loses, and the other player wins.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Notation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Chopfish uses the following notation system:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>State:</strong> = P1L-P1R | P2L-P2R</li>
                            <li><strong>Tap:</strong> P{n}{H1}>P{m}{H2} where n is the attacker, H1 is L/R for the attacker's hand, m is the defender, and H2 is L/R for the defender's hand</li>
                            <li><strong>Split:</strong> Sp(P{n}:X|Y → U|V) where n is the splitting player, X|Y is pre-split, and U|V is post-split</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
